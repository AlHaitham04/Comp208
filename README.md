To access the code you need to have npm (node) installed on you device (for now, later we make it an executable file)
- If its installed you, download everything except the Read me and the 2 screenshot, store it in a folder, go to that folder using the terminal and then write npm run dev, after that open the link that appears on your browser.
- if you don't have it installed use the screenshots as reference and if you need anything send me a message on discord.
